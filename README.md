 # KilnReimagined
 
 https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Frogger/KilnReimagined/
 
 Adds a new carbon-burning oven to replace the vanilla one.
 All recipes are copied (from other mods too). <br>
 But if you want, you can still use the old oven, it is still in the construction menu.

## Created specifically by order of Neb.
